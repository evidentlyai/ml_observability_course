# What the course is about
This course is a deep dive into ML model observability and monitoring. 

We explore different types of evaluations, from data quality to data drift, and how this fits in the model lifecycle. We also cover the engineering aspect of ML observability and how to integrate it with your ML services and pipelines.

# Course structure
ML observability course is organized into six modules. You can follow the complete course syllabus or pick only the modules that are most relevant to you.

# Our approach
* **Blend of theory and practice**. The course combines key concepts of ML observability and monitoring with practice-oriented tasks.
* **Practical code examples**. We provide end-to-end deployment blueprints and walk you through the code examples.
* **Focus on open-source**. The course is built upon open-source tools to make ML observability accessible to all.
* **The course is free and open to everyone**. All course videos are public so you can rewatch them anytime.

# Prerequisites
There are both theoretical and code-focused modules that require knowledge of Python. We will walk you through the code, but you can skip these parts and still learn a lot.

# Who is it for
This course is useful to professionals who have dealt with ML models in production and those preparing to deploy ML models:
* Data scientists,
* ML engineers,
* Technical product managers,
* Analysts.

Let’s dive in!
