**Video 2**. [Train and evaluate an ML model](https://youtu.be/wHBL9zFgA8U?si=7jzJdynEt6tzAKLN), by Emeli Dral

In this video, we prepare the data, train, evaluate, and save an ML model that we will use later in this module to deploy an end-to-end pipeline for data and ML model quality checks. 

**Want to go straight to code?** Here is the [example notebook](https://github.com/evidentlyai/ml_observability_course/blob/main/module5/train_and_evaluate_model_practice.ipynb) to follow along.

**Outline:** \
